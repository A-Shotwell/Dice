LEGEND OF WHITESPIRE
---------------------------

This is a simple game of chance simulating a typical tabletop RPG roll format. You can choose to fight the dragon at any time, but the dragon will always roll high. 
Certain items will supplement your combat roll, and can be obtained depending on your decisions in-game.

Any failed roll that falls within D6 of a save will trigger a "mortal peril" roll, wherein you can roll an additional D6 to save. A tied combat roll will prompts a 
re-roll for both the dragon and the player.
